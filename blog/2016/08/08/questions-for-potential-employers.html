<h1>Questions for potential employers</h1>
<p>Unexpected circumstances have meant I've done two job hunts in recent months. I usually scribble down a handful of questions to ask or consider prior to each interview. Here they are so I can remember and refine them over time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What does the business do? Who's the target market? What's the dream? How big to you want to get etc?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long have you been around? Are you profitable? Have you taken VC? Who are the main people strategically driving the direction of the business?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How big's the dev team? How many people? What roles? Full timers, part timers, contractors? How long have the core members been there? Who would I be reporting to and working with most closely?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How's the leadership structured, and how's work delegated? Top down? Flat? Collaborative? Do you follow any specific development methodologies?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What tech stack are you using? (and subsequently… you mentioned X an Y, which I don't have experience with. Are you OK with that?)
<em>They should at least be fine with you not knowing peripheral technologies in their stack.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are you open to remote work? Does anyone actually work remotely? If so, how often? Have you found it good / bad / indifferent? What are typical work hours? Are you flexible with the times people work? Do people take advantage of that flexibility?<br />
<em>Being "open to remote work" and having people who actually do it are two different things. Likewise for flexible work times.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will I learn from a technical standpoint in this role?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the career growth opportunities - both within this role / company, and if I were to move on in a year or two's time?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you manage technical debt and maintain code quality?<br />
<em>There are lots of valid answers to this. A vague answer is a red flag.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you pay for employees to go to Ruby Conf and Rails Camp (or other equivalents)? Do you do anything else regarding ongoing professional development for your employees?
A "yes" here is good and reveals a lot about general attitude towards employees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are your expectations regarding pay?<br />
<em>I used to be very uncomfortable talking about pay. One of the best life skills you can get is the ability to talk about it in a confident, upfront, open manner.</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Edits: additional questions / comments given to me on twitter:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sevenseacat/status/769855544349773825">Rebecca</a>: "some of those would be useful to ask to both the employer, and one of the devs you would be working with. Compare the answers."</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pat/status/769860587677331457">Pat</a>: I'd be asking questions about culture and diversity - is it on the company's radar? How are they addressing such things? <br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/pat/status/769864749735550976">and</a>: I'd also be keen to hear about leadership (top-down, collaborative, etc) and ownership (profit-sharing? equity?)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RudyYazdi/status/769862693205311488">Rudy</a>: I'd throw in something along the line of: "how do you measure my performance?" type question too ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/grokfail/status/769907753758228480">Garrow</a>: how do you decide what gets built? Who does that? How do you measure the success of built thing?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewdotnich/status/770197793424105473">Andrew</a>: do you have any references? (I have to provide them, so where are yours?)</p>
