<p>Years ago, on the <em>rules page</em> of an online forum, I read something that stuck with me. <strong>"Play the ball, not the man"</strong>. Here's an example of the former:</p>

<blockquote>
Hi Bob, I'd agree with your point A, but your point B contradicts C and D, which I outlined above. How can you reconcile the two?
</blockquote>

<p>Here's an example of the latter:</p>

<blockquote>
Hey Bob-a-job, you fuckstick, can you even FUCKING READ you idiot? Did your mum drop you on your head as a fucking baby? You've totally ignored points C and D. Your whole argument is fucking WORTHLESS. Srsly. People like you are the reason the world is so FUCKED UP.
</blockquote>

<p>Overall, although it's a close call, most would agree the former tone is more conducive to a good dialogue, and is more likely to set the conversation in a direction where both parties will get the best out of it.</p>

<p>I was re-reminded of this when reading the discussion following Jeff Atwood's <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/what-can-men-do/">recent blog post</a>. I also recently came across the term <em><a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument">tone policing</a></em>. I guess some would dismiss the "play the ball not the person" argument as tone-policing.</p>

<p>Regarding tone-policing, the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument">Geek Feiminism wiki</a> states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
The tone argument is a form of derailment, or a red herring, because <strong>the tone of a statement is independent of the content of the statement in question</strong>, and calling attention to it distracts from the issue at hand.
</blockquote>

<p>I'd largely disagree. While the tone of a statement may theoretically be independent of the content, it's just not how we humans tend to take it in practice. Taking the "playing the person" example that I gave above, the recipient of that message is unlikely to say "wait a minute, let me first deconstruct this and separate the tone from the content". Maybe they should, but they won't.</p>

<p>It goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
Drawing attention to the tone rather than content of a statement can allow other parties to avoid engaging with sound arguments presented in that statement, thus undermining the original party's attempt to communicate and effectively shutting them down.
</blockquote>

<p>While it's true that "<em>Drawing attention to the tone rather than content of a statement can allow other parties to avoid engaging with sound arguments presented in that statement</em>", poor tone alone will do the same thing to itself, without having anyone draw attention to it.</p>

<p>I imagine most instances of tone-policing are intended to call the <em>author's</em> attention to the poor tone. The other readers usually don't need their attention called to it - the poor tone calls more than enough attention to itself.</p>

<p>Of course, it's grey scale. Pulling someone up on mild poor tone may well be a red herring. But pulling someone up on a post full of "fucks" and CAPSLOCK is a pretty fair call IMO.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think the whole moral zeitgeist will move forward more quickly if we play the ball not the person, and keep tone on the nice side of the spectrum.</p>

<p>If you disagree, fuck you.
