<p>Here are my goals for 2014. Overall I think they're kinda conservative, but given I've got twin babies, I wanted to set something realistic considering the little free time I have.</p>

<p>I've been developing almost 10 years, but have relatively recently started learning Ruby on Rails, so most are related to furthering my progress in that area.</p>

<h3 id="in-no-particular-order">In no particular order:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Have at least a few live Rails sites under my belt by 2015</li>
  <li>Learn more about server admin, and have an automated solution for Rails hosting (probably learning <a href="http://www.getchef.com/chef/">Chef</a> / <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> etc from the <a href="https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications">"Reliably Deploying Rails Web Apps" book</a>)</li>
  <li>Come up with a solution I'm happy with for hosting Rails apps that my business makes - probably <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a></li>
  <li>Present something (that doesn't totally suck) at <a href="https://github.com/rails-oceania/roro/wiki/rorosyd-topics">Roro Syd meetup</a></li>
  <li>Move from student to mentor at <a href="http://reinteractive.net/community/development_hub">Dev Hub nights</a></li>
  <li>Carry out the <a href="http://joshuapaling.com/post/rails-camp-micro-courses">MicroCourses idea</a> at a RailsCamp &amp; Dev Hub</li>
  <li>Be involved as an organiser or mentor at some Rails community events (apart from Dev Hub)</li>
  <li>Write at least 6 blog posts on dev-related stuff</li>
  <li>Make at least two screencasts (as in, a Ruby / Rails related ones)</li>
  <li>Make a nice responsive admin area theme for Rails, and, ideally, make generators so it can be built easily for each new app. (Or find existing solution to do this - possibly <a href="http://www.railsbricks.net/">Rails Bricks</a>)</li>
  <li>Make a commit to an open source Ruby / Rails gem.</li>
  <li>Make a few responsive websites using a CSS grid system. (I've done responsive sites manually before, but grids seem much easier!)</li>
  <li>Score higher on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">the Joel Test</a>, or at least <a href="http://www.brandonsavage.net/adapting-the-joel-test-to-web-development/">the web dev version of it</a>. (When I first found out about this test a couple of years ago, I was scoring embarrassingly low. I've moved up a decent amount, but there's still room to improve!)</li>
</ol>
