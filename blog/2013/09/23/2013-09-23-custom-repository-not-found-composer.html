<p>Using <a href="http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/php/have-composer-use-development-branches/">these instructions</a>, I was trying to use my own custom repository with composer. I had forked the package <code>kamisama/cake-resque</code> to my own github account and was trying to include my own version in my project.</p>

<p>Here's a simplified version of my composer.json:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/joshuapaling/Cake-Resque.git"
        },
    ],
    "require": {
        "joshuapaling/cake-resque": "dev-master as 3.3.8"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And here's the error I kept coming up against:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - The requested package joshuapaling/cake-resque could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see &lt;https://groups.google.com/d/topic/composer-dev/_g3ASeIFlrc/discussion&gt; for more details.

Read &lt;http://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md&gt; for further common problems.
</code></pre>

<p>Turns out that if you use your own repository, you still need to use the original package name - in my case, <code>kamisama/cake-resque</code> rather than <code>joshuapaling/cake-resque</code></p>

<p>So, my working composer.json looked like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/joshuapaling/Cake-Resque.git"
        },
    ],
    "require": {
        "kamisama/cake-resque": "dev-master as 3.3.8"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The package name is actually defined in the package's own composer.json file - so even though I'd forked the package to my own <code>joshuapaling</code> github account, and the package was now residing at the URL <code>https://github.com/joshuapaling/Cake-Resque.git</code>, that had not influenced the package's name at all, from composers perspective.</p>

<p>A stupid error - but I'm new to composer, and it wasn't clear at first! So, I hope this helps someone else with the same problem.</p>
