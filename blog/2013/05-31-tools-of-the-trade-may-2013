<p><a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/items/2865">Everyone else did this ages ago</a>â€¦ but I'm doing it now. Awesome.</p>

<p>Sometimes I go through a phase of thinking I'm not progressing quickly enough on the coding front, but then I look back 6 months or a year and realise I've actually learned a fair bit. So, I think I'll do a 'tools of the trade' post once every year or something to see how (and if?!) I evolve.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware:</h2>
<p><strong>17 inch macbook pro</strong> with 8GB ram, along side a <strong>24 inch thunderbolt screen</strong>.</p>

<p>2TB <strong>Time Capsule</strong> for backups.</p>

<p><strong>iPad</strong> and <strong>iPhone</strong>: for reading, twitter, and wasting time.</p>

<h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2>

<p><strong>CakePHP</strong>, which I think is great.</p>

<p>When I have to, I also use <strong>Wordpress</strong>. For what it is, I guess it's great in a way, though from a structure / code quality perspective, I think it really sucks.</p>

<p>I'm aware of, and agree with, the criticisms of PHP as a language, so after a long time of putting it off, I've just started learning <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. As of now, I suck at it.</p>

<h2 id="text-editors">Text editors</h2>
<p><strong>Sublime Text 2</strong>. I recently switched from <strong>Coda 2</strong>.</p>

<p>So far the feature I'm loving most is the speed of the quick-open file (Shift-p). Actually, the speed of everything. It's a lot faster than Coda.</p>

<p><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course/">This sublime text tutorial</a> helped me get started with some cool tips.</p>

<h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2>
<p><strong>Chrome</strong>. I switched from <strong>Firefox</strong> because it doesn't work with CodeKit.</p>

<h2 id="version-control---git">Version Control - GIT</h2>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong> for public projects
<strong>BitBucket</strong> for private projects (can't beat unlimited free private repos!)</p>

<p><strong>Tower</strong> as a Git GUI. I don't use the command line when I can avoid it. Tower is the most expensive, but the nicest Git GUI.</p>

<p>Soon I'm going to take another look at <strong>SourceTree</strong> for it's support for more advanced Git workflows.</p>

<p>Transmit: for FTP. I'm embarrassed to say I still deploy via FTP or SFTP. Capistrano deployment is on my do to list, and has been for too long.</p>

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>

<p>Don't tell anyone - I'm still doing it manually. <strong>Capistrano</strong> is on my ToDo list, and has been for waaaaay too long.</p>

<h2 id="frontend">Frontend</h2>
<p>I'm using <strong>SASS</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong>. Have to take a look at an MVC JS solution soon - probably <strong>backbone</strong>. Haven't got round to it yet, though.</p>

<p>I used to use <strong>LiveReload</strong> for refreshing the browser while I work. Now I use <strong>CodeKit</strong>, which is nicer, and has super nice built in support for compiling SASS, combining/minifying Javascript files, and lots more.</p>

<h2 id="database-management">Database management:</h2>
<p><strong>Navicat</strong> for data transfers. <strong>Sequel Pro</strong> for everything else. I'll have to look into a PostGres solution soon (MySQL is pretty standard in the PHP world, but not so much in the Ruby / Rails world).</p>

<h2 id="other-apps-i-like">Other Apps I Like</h2>

<p><strong>DropBox</strong>: For obvious reasons. Our work file organisation system was an embarassing mess prior to dropbox.</p>

<p><strong>Passpack</strong>: Pure awesomeness. No excuse not to have a complex, unique password for everything.</p>

<p><strong>Little Ipsum</strong>: get Lorem Ipsum text from your toolbar.</p>

<p><strong>Alfred 2</strong>: Launch apps quickly. There's a bunch of more advanced features too, but I don't use them.</p>

<p><strong>Total Finder</strong>: Tabs for finder. They should be built in out of the box.</p>

<p><strong>Total Terminal</strong>: Tabs and more for the terminal. I'm going to have to take another look at terminal options as Rails is forcing me to use the terminal a lot more than I have been.</p>

<p><strong>Parallels Desktop</strong>: For testing in Internet Explorer. So, whenever I'm using this app, I'm miserable - but it has to be done!</p>

<p><strong>Reeder</strong>: I was using this for RSS, on my Mac, iPhone and iPad. But, Google Reader has just gone down, and a new version of Reeder hasn't been released. For now I sit in limbo.</p>

<p><strong>Jing</strong>: For making quick screencasts and uploading them to Screencast.com. Massive time saver for helping tech-tarded clients.</p>

<p><strong>ImageOptim</strong>: Free tool to compress images for the web. Better than save for web from photoshop. Simple drag/drop interface, and best of all, FREE!</p>

<p><strong>Textual</strong>: I only recently started using IRC. It's awesome!</p>

<p>There's probably others I've forgotten, but that'll do me for now!</p>
