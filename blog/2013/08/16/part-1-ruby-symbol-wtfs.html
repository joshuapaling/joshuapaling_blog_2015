<p>This post is <a href="http://joshuapaling.com/post/rails-blog-in-15-weeks">part of a series</a></p>

<p>Shortly into <a href="http://www.reinteractive.net/posts/32-ruby-on-rails-3-2-blog-in-15-minutes-step-by-step">Part 1</a> of the rails install fest series, you'll come across Ruby symbols. Symbols are those things prefixed by a colon, such as <code>:posts</code>, <code>:title</code> and <code>:body</code>, which we come across in our database migration in part 1.</p>

<p>This post very briefly explains symbols, from a practical perspective. In doing so, it glosses over some issues, so at the end, I provide some links for those who want the full story.</p>

<p>For reference, here's the migration code from <a href="http://www.reinteractive.net/posts/32-ruby-on-rails-3-2-blog-in-15-minutes-step-by-step">Part 1</a>, which makes use of symbols.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class CreatePosts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :posts do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.text :body

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2 id="what-are-symbols">What are Symbols?</h2>

<p>Symbols are "immutable strings". That is, they're strings that can't be changed.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-symbols-behave">How do symbols behave?</h2>

<p>In order to get an initial grasp Ruby code involving symbols, just mentally substitute the symbol for a string. A Ruby symbol is NOT a string. However, the symbol <code>:posts</code> in Ruby would, in most cases, behave in a similar way to it's equivalent string, <code>'posts'</code>, in other languages such as PHP, Java, etc.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-just-use-strings-then">Why not just use strings, then?</h2>

<p>Two main reasons:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Symbols, being more simple than strings, take up less memory and perform better.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> There are situations where you <em>want</em> an unchanging string. Think of, for example, a database field name, or a hash key (or an array key in PHP). They're pretty much like constants. You wouldn't bother creating a constant variable for referring to them, but you would always refer to them using the exact same string.</p>

<p>Let's compare a PHP array to a Ruby hash:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">// php array
&lt;?php
$user = array( 'first_name' =&gt; 'Joshua' );
echo $user['first_name']; // outputs 'Joshua'
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"># ruby hash
user = { :first_name =&gt; 'Joshua' }
puts user[:first_name] # outputs 'Joshua'
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to manipulate the <em>value</em>, ie, 'Joshua', but the <em>key</em>, 'first_name', never needs to change. You're only using it to access that exact key of the array/hash. It's just an identifier, and you don't care about it in it's own right. You never need to capitalise it, concatentate it, get it's length, etc.</p>

<p>It's a string that <em>shouldn't</em> be changed, so in Ruby, you make it a string that <em>can't</em> be changed - ie, a symbol.</p>

<h2 id="the-long-story">The Long Story</h2>

<p>The topic of symbols has been covered in far more depth, by Rubyists far more knowledgable than myself. And though I've painted a picture of symbols as being almost exactly like strings, they're actually different under the hood, so to speak. Take a look at these resources:</p>
