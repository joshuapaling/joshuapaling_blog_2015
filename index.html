  <p>Unexpected circumstances have meant I've done two job hunts in recent months. I usually scribble down a handful of questions to ask or consider prior to each interview. Here they are so I can remember and refine them over time.</p>

  <p>In year 10, my art teacher stopped me.</p>

  <p>Stop! You're a perfectionist! And perfectionism is a disease!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having been praised for my perfectionism all my life, I dismissed her advice. It took more than a decade for me to realise just how right she...</p>

  <p>In India, one of the top recommendations for young yogis aspiring to enlightenment is "keep the company of the wise".</p>

  <p>I was once told three rules for good writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stern logic</li>
  <li>Clear connections</li>
  <li>Utter simplicity</li>

<p>The same apply to writing software. Forget design patterns and best practices — they're a means to an end, not an end in themselves. If you're code...</p>
