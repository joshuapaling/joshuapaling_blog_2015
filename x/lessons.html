<h1>lessons</h1>

<p>A dev was on contract. It had ended, no one realised. He brought it up. They said they wanted him to go perm, offered a big drop in the contract income. He didn't want it. They said "OK, we'll go week to week" - until they find a full time replacement of course.</p>

<p>Result: he's immediately looking elsewhere. Has no passion, no sense of ownership for current job. Even if they wanted to find a full timer, they should have extended contract for eg. 3 months so that he actually wanted to be there for that time.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: as soon as you let an employee know their time is limited, their heart won't be in it and they're as good as gone.</strong></p>

<p>I got questioned about how I spent my time. "When did you start on task X? How long did it take you to finish it? Did you work on anything else in that time?".</p>

<p>Turns out I was busting my arse working hard. As soon as my ethic was questioned I thought WTF - no more desire to work hard.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: questioning someone's integrity or work ethic has a HUGE cost. Avoid it unless you REALLY, REALLY have to.</strong></p>
