<h1>Jess Tutoring - FAQs</h1>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>I'm a former high school English teacher, but for the past 10 years, since having kids, I've been providing boutique English tutoring.</p>

<p>What do I mean by boutique? I take on a manageable amount of work, take every student seriously, and prepare thoroughly for every lesson. I don't just provide "homework help". If I haven't recently read the book your child is studying, I'll re-read it on my own time, specially for your child. You'll receive detailed feedback from me on your child's progress, and we'll work together on a plan to best support your child's growth and learning.</p>

<p>I specialise in helping primary school students prepare for Opportunity Class, Selective School, and Private Scholarship tests. My students have received scholarships to Pymbal Ladies' College, Methodist Ladies' College, Knox, Sydney Grammer, and more.</p>

<p>However, if your child just wants some help to keep up in class, I can absolutely do that too.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-rates-how-is-payment-made">What are your rates? How is payment made?</h2>

<p>Primary:
$50 for 30m
$90 for 1h</p>

<p>High School:
$110 for 1h</p>

<p>Cash only. Paid in advance, for a full term.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-dont-want-a-full-term-of-lessons">What if I don't want a full term of lessons?</h2>

<p>Typically I don't do this - but speak to me about your situation.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-make-up-lessons-work">How do make up lessons work?</h2>

<p>Please notify me 1 week in advance. I'll aim to provide an alternative mutually agreeable time, and when that's not possible, you'll receive a credit for the following term.</p>

<p>Lessons cancelled with less than 1 week notice will be forfeited.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-you-tutor">Where do you tutor?</h2>

<p>I tutor from my home, a short walk from North Curl Curl Primary School.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-do-zoom-lessons">Do you do zoom lessons?</h2>

<p>Yes - though only for high school children.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-im-not-happy">What if I'm not happy?</h2>

<p>If you'd like to cancel because you're unhappy with my tutoring, let me know and you'll receive a refund on your previous 2 lessons, plus any others remaining in the term.</p>

<h2 id="how-long-before-ill-see-results">How long before I'll see results?</h2>

<p>While students start improving right away, it usually takes 2 terms of regular tutoring to see a significant difference.</p>
