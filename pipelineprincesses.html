    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <p>We want to help stop water waste in Australia using our water filter system.</p>

    <h2>Our Design</h2>
    <p>Our design is a filter system made out of pipes that connect to your drain and tap. The water comes down the drain and into the system. Then it will go through a cleaning process. One pipe injects chlorine into the water to get rid of bacteria then the pipe will insert in a specially made soap that will stop any chlorine from damaging skin or hair. Then your water will come out clean and will smell great.</p>

    <h2>Why we chose water waste</h2>
    <p>We chose water waste because it is a big issue in Australia. Did you know the average Australian uses over 274 Litres of water per day. That is just for one person. We have a lot of water wastage in Australia and although they are already really big our water usage numbers are just getting higher. In 2020 14,270 Gigalitres of water were used. In 2024 9,320 Giglitres were used.</p>
