<h1>AAA Useful</h1>

The most useful thing I can be doing is work for Luxury Escapes, that pushes forward the company mission and my career.

The least useful thing I can be doing is youtube, or anything on any other social media site including Facebook Marketplace.

In between is things that expand my expertise. But these are a distant second to work. Doing has much more impact than developing more expertise.

### Very useful things

1. Make the E2Es more reliable.
   1. Pick one flakey E2E (or one in purgatory)
   2. Run it 100x using the tool
   3. Change til it runs 100x successfully
2. Project to let Admin portal connect to OpenAI directly
3. Find more ways to leverage LLMs effectively
   1. AI PR reviews for more PRs
   2. AI to help get started on tickets & provide relevant context. Build a tool that takes a JIRA ticket, picks which codebase to edit, identifies points in that codebase to change, etc, and maybe even opens a draft PR?
      1. Probably a how-to guide is better here, and less effort. Prove it works on a few tickets.
   3. AI to push forward quality metrics
      1. Improve docs
      2. Update packages
4. Admin portal quality of life improvements
   1. AI chat bot with access to page info
   2. Devs page with links to LPC, LPP etc deals
5. On boarding
   1. Can you follow current instructions and set up an env from scratch, easily?
   2. What training materials are missing? What are the concepts everyone should know?
      1. Eg. the white labels
      2. Eg. LuxPlus+
      3. Eg. the most common acronyms


### Useless things

These things may occasionally provide gems of useful info but are on the whole very net negative.

1. Youtube
2. X / Twitter
3. Facebook including Marketplace
4. Any other social media

### Alternatives to useless things

For when you don't have the willpower to work, but want something less useless than social media.
