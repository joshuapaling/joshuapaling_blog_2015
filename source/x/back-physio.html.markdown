<h1>Back Physio</h1>

## After tweaking back

Inflamed disk takes 6 weeks to heal, even if it feels better after 1 week. Leave it at least 3 weeks before surfing, skateboarding, etc.
If it's bad, no lifting - not even 2kg - for 3 weeks.

Stick to easy variations of exercises.

Avoid stretching positions that aggravate lower back, which includes "pike" stretch.

## Exercises

### [Tabletop - core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-thg0b_8QkQ)

On back, engage core, lift one knee up, then the other.
Move one leg out, keeping shin horizontal. Alternate.
Small movements, keep core and pelvic floor on.

### [Bird Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiFNA3sqjCA)

On all fours, lift alternate arm/leg. Focus on no movement / dipping in pelvis. Keep core engaged, belly to spine.

Easy variation: just move one leg back across the floor, then back in. No arm movement.

### Baby Toes

Lie on back. Pillows under head, propping head right up.

Engage core, and lift legs up. Keep toes hanging, not pointed or flexed.

Hold for 1 min.

### On tummy bend knee

Lie on tummy. Suck belly to spine like you're lying on hot concrete and trying to avoid it.

Then, bend one knee. Alternate.
