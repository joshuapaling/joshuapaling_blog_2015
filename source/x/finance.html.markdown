The figures get increasingly important as you go down - with profit being the most important figure.

**TTV:** The top line. Total Sales. Everything that passes through the til. The total sum of everything purchased. Looks good if it's growing, but utlimately the least meaningful figure on this page.

**Gross sales:** Same as TTV.

**Net Sales:** Gross sales, less non-operational costs. This includes discounts/promos, refunds, and allowances / partial discounts (eg. goodwill credit for poor experience).

**Gross Profit:** TTV minus cost of goods sold (at LE, payment to hotels)

**Gross Margin / Net Margin:** sometimes used interchangeably with gross/net profit, but technically should be "as %", so eg. LE makes ~20% gross profit on Flash.

**Contribution margin:** net margin, less the variable costs of incremental sales (marketing costs, promo codes, commissions, merchant fees. Notably, does NOT include fixed costs like employees, software licenses, rent, etc - those don't go up if you make a few extra (ie, incremental) sales. Though they will go up if you triple sales.

**EBITDA:** Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation. 

A software company will have:
Depreciation from office equipment, printers, etc.
Amortisation from the cost of developing new software products, which can be CapEx'd up front then amortised over time.
If the company has debt financing, it'll pay intererst on that debt.
And if it makes a profit, it'll pay tax on that profit.

**EBIT:** Earnings before interest and tax.

**Operating Profit:** EBIT, but with non-operating income and expenses excluded. So it excludes interest, taxes, earnings from non-core activities (eg investments) and costs from non-core activites (eg legal settlements).

Non-operating: not relating to core, day to day activities.
Non-operating income: asset sales, investment income, FX transaction income.
Non-operating expenses: legal settlements, interest payments.

**Net Profit:** The bottom line. What really matters. The money left over after everything else is paid.
