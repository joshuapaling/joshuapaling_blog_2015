<p class="lead">I just came across this in my CakePHP app. Posting my fix here, to aid any of you error code googlers.

Turns out in my case the issue was just that one of my fixtures had an extra field in the $records array, which didnâ€™t belong to that model / database table. Get rid of that, and the error disappears. Too easy!</p>
