I hate VIM. But when I'm SSHing, I have to use it. This is a note-to-self, reminding myself of the bare minimum basics, so I don't have to Google them every time.

~~~bash
HJKL # left, up, down, right
0 # go to beginning of line
$ # go to end of line

i # go into insert mode
esc # leave insert mode
~~~

in command mode:

~~~bash
:w # save
:wq # save and quit
:q # quit
~~~

Here's a [good reference](http://www.radford.edu/~mhtay/CPSC120/VIM_Editor_Commands.htm) for more commands:
