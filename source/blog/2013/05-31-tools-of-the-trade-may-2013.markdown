title: My Tools of the Trade
tags:
---

[Everyone else did this ages ago](http://www.rubyflow.com/items/2865)â€¦ but I'm doing it now. Awesome.

Sometimes I go through a phase of thinking I'm not progressing quickly enough on the coding front, but then I look back 6 months or a year and realise I've actually learned a fair bit. So, I think I'll do a 'tools of the trade' post once every year or something to see how (and if?!) I evolve.

## Hardware:
**17 inch macbook pro** with 8GB ram, along side a **24 inch thunderbolt screen**.

2TB **Time Capsule** for backups.

**iPad** and **iPhone**: for reading, twitter, and wasting time.

## Frameworks

**CakePHP**, which I think is great.

When I have to, I also use **Wordpress**. For what it is, I guess it's great in a way, though from a structure / code quality perspective, I think it really sucks.

I'm aware of, and agree with, the criticisms of PHP as a language, so after a long time of putting it off, I've just started learning **Ruby on Rails**. As of now, I suck at it.

##Text editors
**Sublime Text 2**. I recently switched from **Coda 2**.

So far the feature I'm loving most is the speed of the quick-open file (Shift-p). Actually, the speed of everything. It's a lot faster than Coda.

[This sublime text tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course/) helped me get started with some cool tips.

## Browsers
**Chrome**. I switched from **Firefox** because it doesn't work with CodeKit.

## Version Control - GIT

**GitHub** for public projects
**BitBucket** for private projects (can't beat unlimited free private repos!)

**Tower** as a Git GUI. I don't use the command line when I can avoid it. Tower is the most expensive, but the nicest Git GUI.

Soon I'm going to take another look at **SourceTree** for it's support for more advanced Git workflows.

Transmit: for FTP. I'm embarrassed to say I still deploy via FTP or SFTP. Capistrano deployment is on my do to list, and has been for too long.

## Deployment

Don't tell anyone - I'm still doing it manually. **Capistrano** is on my ToDo list, and has been for waaaaay too long.

## Frontend
I'm using **SASS** and **jQuery**. Have to take a look at an MVC JS solution soon - probably **backbone**. Haven't got round to it yet, though.

I used to use **LiveReload** for refreshing the browser while I work. Now I use **CodeKit**, which is nicer, and has super nice built in support for compiling SASS, combining/minifying Javascript files, and lots more.

## Database management:
**Navicat** for data transfers. **Sequel Pro** for everything else. I'll have to look into a PostGres solution soon (MySQL is pretty standard in the PHP world, but not so much in the Ruby / Rails world).


## Other Apps I Like

**DropBox**: For obvious reasons. Our work file organisation system was an embarassing mess prior to dropbox.

**Passpack**: Pure awesomeness. No excuse not to have a complex, unique password for everything.

**Little Ipsum**: get Lorem Ipsum text from your toolbar.

**Alfred 2**: Launch apps quickly. There's a bunch of more advanced features too, but I don't use them.

**Total Finder**: Tabs for finder. They should be built in out of the box.

**Total Terminal**: Tabs and more for the terminal. I'm going to have to take another look at terminal options as Rails is forcing me to use the terminal a lot more than I have been.

**Parallels Desktop**: For testing in Internet Explorer. So, whenever I'm using this app, I'm miserable - but it has to be done!

**Reeder**: I was using this for RSS, on my Mac, iPhone and iPad. But, Google Reader has just gone down, and a new version of Reeder hasn't been released. For now I sit in limbo.

**Jing**: For making quick screencasts and uploading them to Screencast.com. Massive time saver for helping tech-tarded clients.

**ImageOptim**: Free tool to compress images for the web. Better than save for web from photoshop. Simple drag/drop interface, and best of all, FREE!

**Textual**: I only recently started using IRC. It's awesome!

There's probably others I've forgotten, but that'll do me for now!
