I [did this last year](/blog/2014/11/16/2014-development-goals.html). Been meaning to do it this year (I've had goals in my head since the beginning of the year). We're almost a third the way though 2015, but I've finally got around to writing them down.

## 1. Get a lot better at Ruby

As in plain ruby, without rails. Eg. I want to fully understand the difference between blocks, procs and lamdas without having to google it. I want to have a whole lot more of Ruby's built in classes and methods memorised. I want to get a LOT better at reading other's ruby code (eg. in gems)

## 2. Get a lot better at Javascript

I feel like I'm almost there with understanding javascripts odities. I'm still not really sure how to organise my javascript code once I have more than a small amount of it. I want to get confident structuring JS code, deciding which of the many non-class code reuse patterns to use and when, etc. I don't love javascript, but it looks like it's basically the future, so I'm going to have to get much better at it.

## 3. Try another language

Maybe python. Or maybe rust or go. I don't aim to get good at it - just to try it out, see how it differs. Maybe write something like Game of Life in it or something.

## 4. Attend RORO often, and give at least a few talks

With my wife no longer working on a Tuesday night, I can go to RORO. yay. I also want to try and give several beginner-related Ruby/Rails talks - both to solidify my own understanding, and to provide some much needed beginner friendly (and Ruby-centric!) content.

## 5. Learn Ansible

I'm embarrassingly bad at server admin. One of my goals last year was "Come up with a solution I'm happy with for hosting Rails apps that my business makes". I found an outcome that I thought I was happy with, and that I thought would avoid the need for me to learn server stuff. But I was wrong - I really just have to bite the bullet and get better at it.

One of the reasons I'm so bad is that I always do it ad-hoc. I think learning one of the Infrastructure as Code tools will go a long way to helping me get better. I've heard Ansible is the most straight forward.

## 6. Make a few contributions to open source

Just a few, to projects that aren't mine. I'll be happy with that.

## 7. Make a gem. And get comfortable with the way they work

I have some stuff for admin areas that I end up duplicating each new project, so that's a good candidate for my first gem.

## 8. Learn D3

This was one of my goals at the beginning of this year - I've already done a project using it, so although I'm no expert, I'm over the first hump. This goal's already done.

## 9. Learn React.

Ditto D3 above. A goal at the beginning of the year. I've done it already - or at least, done one project and understand the basics.

## 10. Write at least 10 blog posts

Last year my goal was 6. I want to bump it up this year. They don't have to be super high quality. I want my focus for my blog to be just about me learning stuff, and keeping stuff for future reference. I'll put it online for the heck of it, but I don't want that to mean that I get bogged down too much in a 'quality over quantity' mentality. If it's good enough for me to learn something from it, then it's good enough to count as a blog post.

## 11. Make at least 2 screencasts

This was a goal for last year and I didn't do it. They don't have to be amazing, but I do want to check it off this year.

## 12. Go to bed by 10 or 10:30, and maintain decent work/life balance.

I regularly slip into the schedule of coding til midnight, and spending all my time coding or reading/watching tech-related stuff in a desparate attempt to get better and stay on top of things. Every so often I start to feel burnt out. I'm pretty good at calling myself out on it when that does happen, and setting a strict schedule to avoid excessive work - but this year, I want to try and avoid even getting to that point in the first place. It's already happened once so far in 2015. On that note, it's 10:34pm, so I guess that'll my last goal for this year.
