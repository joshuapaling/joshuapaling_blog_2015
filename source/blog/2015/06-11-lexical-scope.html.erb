In this post, we're going to understand what "lexical scope" means. When understanding programming concepts, I find it's first often useful to clarfiy/understand the (non-programming-related) meaning of the words used to describe them. So, let's start with some definitions:

## Lexical

**Lexicon:** the vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge. *Eg. "the size of the English lexicon"**

**Lexical:** relating to a lexicon. IE, relating to the words or vocabulary of a language. *Eg. "lexical analysis"*

Remember, *language* in these definitions refers to regular, spoken languages - not programming languages.

So, someone's **lexicon** is basically the words they know - their vocabulary. Someone's **lexical knowledge** is basically "what they know about all the English words".

## Scope

**Scope:** the extent of the area or subject matter that something deals with or to which it is relevant. *Eg. "we widened the scope of our investigation"*

## Lexical Scope

Putting the two words together, *lexical scope* means something like: *the extent/area of a lexicon (ie, stuff in a language) that something deals with.*

## Lexical Scope in Programming

In programming, *lexical* refers to the "words" and constructs of a programming language, as opposed to a spoken language. And *scope* refers to the concept of scope we're familiar with in programming - eg. "local scope", "global scope", etc. Scope describes where a particular thing (variable, object, function, etc) is available.
