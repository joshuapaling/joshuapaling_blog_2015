In India, one of the top recommendations for young yogis aspiring to enlightenment is "keep the company of the wise".

I gave up on enlightenment a while ago, but the same applies to any aspiration. Sometimes there's a tendency — at conferences, meetups, and in the work place— to want to stick to your own crowd. I'm a junior, I should stick with other juniors.

Actively fight that urge. Find the best people. Find the ones with the most wisdom to share. Then pull them off that pedestal, because you should never have put them up there in the first place, and talk to them.

Keep the company of the wise.
