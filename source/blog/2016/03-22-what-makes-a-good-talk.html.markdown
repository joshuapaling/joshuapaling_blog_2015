After Ruby Conf AU, I came away noticing a few common traits of good talks:

## Excellent delivery

On stage, you’re not just speaking, you’re performing. Turn the enthusiasm up a few notches from what you’d use in a face-to-face conversation. Don’t just stand behind the podium and read.

## A story

Don’t present points. A blog post can do that. Bring some personal anecdotes in, and weave a story out of the information you’re presenting. Relive the emotions you felt at the time. This comes back to the idea of ‘performing’.

## Great Tech talks require great examples

Distill the technical idea to the smallest, most basic possible representation. Come up with a simple, self-contained example domain for all code demonstrated. Most people don’t do this and their talks are much worse for it. (The quote *‘I wrote a long letter because I didn’t have time to write you a short one’* comes to mind)
