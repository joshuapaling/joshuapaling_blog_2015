title: My 2014 Development Goals
tags: goals
---

Here are my goals for 2014. Overall I think they're kinda conservative, but given I've got twin babies, I wanted to set something realistic considering the little free time I have.

I've been developing almost 10 years, but have relatively recently started learning Ruby on Rails, so most are related to furthering my progress in that area.

### In no particular order:

1. Have at least a few live Rails sites under my belt by 2015
2. Learn more about server admin, and have an automated solution for Rails hosting (probably learning [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/) / [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) etc from the ["Reliably Deploying Rails Web Apps" book](https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications))
3. Come up with a solution I'm happy with for hosting Rails apps that my business makes - probably [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/)
4. Present something (that doesn't totally suck) at [Roro Syd meetup](https://github.com/rails-oceania/roro/wiki/rorosyd-topics)
5. Move from student to mentor at [Dev Hub nights](http://reinteractive.net/community/development_hub)
6. Carry out the [MicroCourses idea](http://joshuapaling.com/post/rails-camp-micro-courses) at a RailsCamp & Dev Hub
7. Be involved as an organiser or mentor at some Rails community events (apart from Dev Hub)
8. Write at least 6 blog posts on dev-related stuff
9. Make at least two screencasts (as in, a Ruby / Rails related ones)
10. Make a nice responsive admin area theme for Rails, and, ideally, make generators so it can be built easily for each new app. (Or find existing solution to do this - possibly [Rails Bricks](http://www.railsbricks.net/))
11. Make a commit to an open source Ruby / Rails gem.
12. Make a few responsive websites using a CSS grid system. (I've done responsive sites manually before, but grids seem much easier!)
13. Score higher on [the Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html), or at least [the web dev version of it](http://www.brandonsavage.net/adapting-the-joel-test-to-web-development/). (When I first found out about this test a couple of years ago, I was scoring embarrassingly low. I've moved up a decent amount, but there's still room to improve!)
