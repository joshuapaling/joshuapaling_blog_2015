"It's not a bug it's a feature: a programmers guide to the human brain"

Sleep: you can imagine many a cave man over the years have met their demise due to their bodies need for sleep - that it spends several hours a day oblivious to the hungry wild animals hunting for food around it. You'd only keep needing sleep if it was really critical for something.

Do a post explaining in simple terms:

- cross site request forgery
- cross site scripting
- authentication, authorisation (single sign on, JWTs, etc)
- value of cleaning up work code in the evening, so you learn "what good code looks like"
- Approach to code linting and testing, and the mistakes I've consistently seen (don't test controllers, make it easy to run a single test case, etc)
- Post about our 2 ORMs in lux, and when to build your own, vs rely on open source
- Post about code review.
